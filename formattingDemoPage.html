        <h3>Bold and Strong</h3>
            <b>This is bold text</b>
        <p>
            The strong tag has the same visual effect as the bold tag but the 
            strong tag also marks the enclosed text as more important.

        <strong>This is what strong text looks like.</strong>
        <h3>Italic and Emphasis</h3>
            <i>This text is in italics</i>
        <p>
            The emphasis tag has the same visual effect as the italic tag but the emphasis tag also marks the enclosed text as more important.

        <em>This is what emphasized text looks like.</em>
        <h3>Subscript and Superscript</h3>
        <p>
            Subscript text looks like this: <sub>This is subscript</sub></br>

        </p>
